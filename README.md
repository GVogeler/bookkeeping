Ontology for the RDF description of historical accounting .

The ontology describes basic economic activities as being recording in bookkeeping records (https://msu.edu/~mccarth4/) in history. It is based on the Resource-Event-Actor model and thus can abstract from the actual method of bookkeeping (single entry, double entry). It is meant to be compliant with CIDOC-CRM although at the current state formal reference is not complete.

A major application of the ontology can be found in the DEPCHA project (https://gams.uni-graz.at/context:depcha).
